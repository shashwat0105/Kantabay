        content: 'It seems like we are living with COVID-19 forever because it has prevailed so much and is here for so long. And also, it has no mood to go back from where it came. It is obvious now that Corona is not going anywhere. Instead, we have to accept it and need to live with it because there is no other option left. Considering the world where Corona has wreaked havoc, people think twice before hiring a maid. The health of the maid they ought to hire is a big concern for them. Before COVID-19, MaidsApp was slightly different because we changed the policies. Unlike now, there was no need for preventive measures before Corona. The maids used to go without masks and sanitizers to all the places. There is only one thing that never changed, and that is the professional attitude of the MaidsApp. The company was always a proficient cleaning service and always thought about the ease and convenience of the company. Now the company is more vigilant about its customer health and wellbeing. For that purpose, all the maids got their vaccines and are completely secure and free from Corona. Therefore, there is no need to worry about the sanitation and hygiene of the cleaners.',
